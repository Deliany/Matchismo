/**
 * A SetGameDeck  consists of 81 cards varying in four features: number (one, two, or three); symbol (diamond, squiggle, oval); shading (solid, striped, or open); and color (red, green, or purple).[1] Each possible combination
 * of features (e.g., a card with three striped green diamonds) appears precisely once in the deck.
